                <span className="bold">tldr:</span> I'm Joseph Eggers, a self
                taught software developer who loves to create projects and write
                code.
              </p>
              <p>
                In college, I studied physics because I wanted to understand the
                mathematics of our reality. At the culmination of my college
                experience, I was more entranced by the coding i`n the software
                than by the physics I was studying. I chose to pursue
                programming after college and immersed myself in courses, docs,
                and projects.
              </p>
              <p>
                I remember writing my first lines of code and being amazed with
                how code can create anything. My first distinct memory of code
                was being blown away by CSS (design). I was able to shape my
                websites in ways I never imagined. At first it was the simple
                things: float left; background color; margin, but the little
                design changes blew my mind`. Like a rainbow trout on a fishing
                line, it was game and I was hooked.
              </p>
              <p>
                Good design is something anybody could recognize, but being able
                to create takes practice and dedication. The void between what I
                wanted to create and what I could create eventually started to
                grow closer together. Combining the process of coding to
                designing to build..., to forge, brings its own satisfaction as
                I get better and better.
              </p>

                When I‚Äôm not coding, the most important things to me are time
                with my beautiful{' '}

                <d style={{ color: '#e0e0e0' }}>fiance </d>wife Laura, family,
                and friends. On my off time, I love playing board games, casting
                magic missile in D&D, watching movies, and coding. As you read
                this, I‚Äôm probably typing away coding for fun, with a vintage
                copy of Risk underneath my computer.
